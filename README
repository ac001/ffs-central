******************************************************************************
This is the development version, so you must build it by yourself.
Anyway, it's very simple with cmake. For now, program don't find icons when they aren't in kde standard place.
So, it's better to install it on /usr instead of /usr/local

To ensure not pollute the source, it's strongly recommended to build program in a sub-directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

KFreeFlight need qt and kde libs (dev packages).

******************************************************************************
What is it?
-----------

This program is a GUI front-end for launching FlightGear.
I made it to be as open as possible and I try to puts the most common options but
if you see a important missing, please send me an email.

Why KFreeFlight ?
-----------------

Because all program I find doesn't have the common options I use.
(NMEA for example) or can't be set up for using with an "exotic" 
GNU/Linux Distribution (like GENTOO or LFS) or a FlightGear source-based installation.
Otherwise to have fun in programming.
******************************************************************************

WARNING : the options you enter are not verify by the program and can render
FlightGear unstable with bad options (ex character in place of number, etc...)
